The application was a role-based school fundraising management system.  
Users could log in as students, teachers, or treasurers, each with different permissions.  
Authorized roles were able to create, edit, and manage fundraising campaigns, while students could mark payments as completed, comment on fundraisers, and report issues.  
The system focused on structured role management, permissions handling, and interactive communication between users.
